                    <li>HPHY 422 Cardiovascular Physiology
                        <p>This course is designed for upper division students and will expand on the core
                            cardiovascular concepts covered in HPHY 242. The course is designed to help students develop
                            a detailed understanding of the physiology and regulation of the cardiovascular system. The
                            course will cover concepts of myocardial function, peripheral vascular function and the
                            integration and regulation of these two components of the cardiovascular system.
                            Instructor: Dr. Thorp

                    <li>HPHY 451 Systems Neurophysiology
                        <p>
                            The course is an advanced examination of the cellular and physiological properties of
                            neurons, neural communication / transmission, and the physiological manifestations of the
                            nervous systems control. After examining neural cell function, we begin by exploring the
                            neurophysiological systems involved in sensory pathways including proprioception and
                            vestibular system, pain, vision, auditory, and chemical senses. Then, we apply this
                            knowledge by examining the integration of these systems and their role in normal human
                            physiological function, disease, and performance. Fall or Spring on need. Instructor: Dr. Lewis

                    <li>HPHY 453 Neuroanatomy
                        <p>
                            This course offers an in-depth study of the anatomical organization of the human nervous
                            system. Through a combination of lecture and hands-on laboratory experience, students will
                            explore the gross and microscopic structure of the brain and spinal cord, and the
                            relationships between structure and function. Students will also gain practical experience
                            in the handling and examination of human brain specimens. Instructor: Dr. Measor

                    <li>HPHY 477 Environmental Physiology
                        <p>An in-depth study of specific topics in environmental physiology, including the cellular and
                            systemic responses and adaptations of various organ systems (cardiovascular, pulmonary,
                            renal etc) to environmental stress including temperature, pressure, altitude,
                            chemicals/toxins, and others. Instructor: Dr. Crosswhite
                        </p>

                    <li>HPHY 480 Applied Immunology
                        <p>Begins as a basic immunology course with a focus on immune cells and their development
                            leading to proper or improper immune function and regulation. Second half of the course
                            applies basic principles of immunology to dive into depth on tumor responses, autoimmune
                            conditions, asthma, allergies transplants, etc. Students finish the course by applying what
                            they have learned to an immune topic of their choice for a final presentation. Instructor: Dr. Deckert

                    <li>HPHY 489 Fundamentals of Human Skeletal Muscle Physiology
                        <p>This course is designed to offer a comprehensive exploration of the intricate world of
                            skeletal muscle physiology and function. Through a multidimensional approach encompassing
                            different aspects, students will gain insights into muscle contractions, metabolic processes,
                            and adaptive responses. Delving into cutting-edge research, the course highlights the
                            crucial role skeletal muscles play in overall health, physical performance, and disease
                            prevention. Engaging lectures, interactive discussions, and independent research projects
                            provide a well-rounded learning experience to allow students to develop a profound
                            understanding of skeletal muscle dynamics and their impact on well-being.

                    <li>HPHY 489 Neuroendocrine Physiology
                        <p>
                            This course will examine the relationship between the nervous system and the endocrine
                            system in humans and other mammals. Topics that will be discussed include the regulation of
                            feeding and energy balance, reproduction, the stress response, and biological rhythms. The
                            course will be delivered through a combination of lecture, class discussions of current and
                            foundational primary research, and the drafting of a novel research proposal designed to
                            answer a scientific question of the student's choice. Instructor: Dr. Alex Miller

                        <p>
                            This course will broadly cover the field of orthotics and prosthetics as it relates to
                            biomechanics and anatomy and physiology, as well as the psychosocial components of disability.
                            Prosthetics and orthotics, commonly referred to as O&P , is a unique field that aims to help
                            individuals enhance their quality of life and restore function. As a prosthetist and orthotist,
                            we work closely with doctors, physical therapists and occupational therapists to give our
                            patients the best possible outcome. We will also explore bionics, osseointegration, running
                            blades, and other specialty topics. Instructor: Bassel Mufarreh, MSOP

            <h3>Can I register for two HPHY 489 courses in one semester?</h3>
            <p class="preview">Zagweb doesn't allow it, but to get around this you can...</p>
        </summary>
        <div class="faq-content">
            <p>
                Zagweb views all 489s as the same course and will only allow you to register yourself for one course.
                How you can register for two is by the following. On the morning of your registration, enroll in your
                preferred 489 section. Then email the instructor of the second course & me (crosswhite@gonzaga.edu) and
                you will see a form to fill out. Requests before your registration window opens will not be considered.

                Due to the high number of electives being offered, there will be limited opportunities for registering
                for a full course and requires approval from department chair (me) not the instructor. Your best bet is
                to monitor Zagweb throughout the registration window of November up until the point of the beginning of
                the spring semester.

                    If there are seniors who need Chem 307/L but have not taken Chem 102/L (which is a pre-requisite), we will sign a waiver to allow these seniors to take Chem 307/L in Spring 2026. Students will need to contact Gemma D'Ambruoso (dambruoso@gonzaga.edu) with their student ID# ahead of their registration period. Non-senior students who want to take Chem 307/L but have not yet taken Chem 102/L should register for Chem 102/L next semester or any spring BEFORE they plan to take Chem 307/L.

                <li>
                    The Chem department has permanently changed the pre-requisite courses for Chem 307/L and have made these changes already with the Registrar's Office for Spring 2026. Chem 231/L is no longer a pre-requisite or co-requisite for Chem 307/L. The pre-requisites for Chem 307/L are now Chem 102/L and Chem 230/L (all with a C- or higher grade).
